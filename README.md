# Entity-Extractor
Built UI in React and applied NER on the text to get enities and showing it on UI. Used spacy large model to extract the entities and cleaned the data for better results. Data processing wasn't an easy task but achieved it by observing the data. User could upload the .pdf file and get the entities with a score that was referred as award of a contract. (Spacy, NER, Flask, React)
Built to get award from a contract.
